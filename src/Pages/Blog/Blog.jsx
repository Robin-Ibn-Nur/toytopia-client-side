            excerpt:
                "An access token is a short- lived token that is used to authenticate a user to a service.A refresh token is a long - lived token that can be used to obtain a new access token when the old one expires. Access tokens and refresh tokens are typically stored in the browser's local storage or cookies. Access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side. They should not be stored in plain text, as they could be intercepted by an attacker. Access tokens and refresh tokens should be encrypted and stored in a secure location.",

            excerpt:
                "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases. SQL databases are relational databases, while NoSQL databases are non-relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. NoSQL databases store data in a variety of formats, including documents, key-value pairs, and graphs. SQL databases are typically used for applications that require a lot of data to be stored and queried. NoSQL databases are typically used for applications that require a lot of flexibility in how data is stored and queried.",
